        <h1 id="future-predictions">Future Predictions</h1>
<p>These are a set of predictions about what's going to happen in the future.</p>
<p>Each prediction will have conditions that need to be met in order for them to
be considered true as well as conditions that indicate if the prediction was wrong.</p>
<p>Each prediction is meant to be falsifiable to avoid making broad claims that could
be considered having come to pass because of ambiguous assertions.</p>

<p>Human level artificial intelligence will be a reality by the year 2030</p>

<p>The fundamental assumptions for this prediction are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Human cognition is the result of simple algorithms working in parallel on massive data sets</li>
<li>The human brain capacity is roughly 2.3 Pb of information</li>
<li>Hard disk space is a good proxy for the feasibility of producing human level intelligence</li>
<li>AI will be achieved when commodity hardware is available, in the form of roughly a $1000 option, that has the compute and storage of the human brain (3.2Pb)</li>
</ul>
<p>Using <a href="https://jcmit.net/diskprice.htm">jcmit.net/diskprice</a> as a source, depending on how you count, hard drive prices fall at a rate of 1/2 every 2-3 years.
As of this writing, the prices is about $\$$150/8Tb (.00000000001705302565 $\$$US/byte).</p>
<p>$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{\$ 1000}{2.3 \text{Pb} \cdot 2^{10} }   &amp; = 2^{-y \alpha}\frac{\$150}{8 \text{Tb}}  \\
\to y  &amp;= \frac{ - \lg{\left( \frac{8000}{2.3 \cdot 150 \cdot 2^{10} }\right)} }{\alpha} \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$</p>
<p>$y$ is the number of years and 
$\alpha$ is the doubling factor.
If $\alpha \in (\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3})$, this gives a timeline of roughly 10 to 16 years before we'll see a hard drive that has the storage capacity of the human brain for
about $\$$1000 USD.</p>
<p>The 2030 prediction is a bit aggressive and considering Moore's law might be slowing down, the timeline might be closer to 2040.
Regardless, I am staying with my 2030 prediction.</p>

<p>A crypto currency, most likely Bitcoin, will be a major global currency, storing at least %20 of the global wealth by 2030</p>

<p>I believe Bitcoin to be the most likely leader as there's so much work and buy in currently, but this could change.
A good rule of thumb of crypto currency not taking over is that if the USD price per coin is not high <strong>or</strong> the
price per coin is very high but is not in widespread usage, signaling that it's being used by the wealthy as a kind
of modern stock market.</p>
<p>The prediction of 2030 is done by using historic USD-BTC price (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/history/">src</a>) and roughly
fitting an exponential curve (by "eye").
Bitcoin is still in it's infancy so it's highly volatile, so this prediction might be significantly off.</p>
<p>Part of this prediction is the fact that crypto currency solves a lot of problems and opens up new avenues for global trade:</p>
<ul>
<li>Online purchases have the potential to be much easier</li>
<li>Money transfers have the potential to be much more seamless and cheap</li>
<li>Currency exchanges (for purchases, etc.) are normalized to a de-factor standard (e.g. Bitcoin)</li>
<li>Non provincial ownership allowing for de-centralized operation and direction</li>
</ul>
<p>As a side note, total global wealth as of 2019 is estimated to be $\$$360T
($ \$360 \cdot 10^{12} $) (<a href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/reports-research/global-wealth-report.html">src</a>).
If Bitcoin is capped at 21M coins and establishes itself by storing %20 of the $\$$360T, this gives $ \frac{ \$360T \cdot 0.2 }{ 21M BTC } \approx \$3.4M/BTC $.</p>

<p>Swanson's law (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swanson%27s_law">w</a>) has photo voltaic cell prices falling at about 10% per year.
This is roughly a price halving every 6-7 years.
Current prices are about $\$$0.75 / W for low volume consumer panels and $\$$0.20 / W for higher volumes.</p>
<p>I guess there's debate on whether batteries follow a Moore's law like price curve (<a href="https://longtailpipe.com/2013/04/06/there-is-moores-law-for-batteries-its/">src</a> <a href="https://longtailpipe.com/2013/04/06/there-is-moores-law-for-batteries-its/">src</a>) but prices are falling at about %20 per year (<a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/behind-scenes-take-lithium-ion-battery-prices/">src</a>) perhaps due to Wright's law (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_curve_effects">w</a>).
Regardless, as of this writing, lead acid batteries are at $\$$0.15/Wh and lithium batteries look to be somewhere in the range of $\$$0.15/Wh to $\$$0.05/Wh.</p>
<p>The average US household consumes 30 kWh per day.
Assuming a 12 hour sunlight window, that's $30 kWh / 12h = 2500 W$ needed.
The average American pays $\$$0.1854/kWh leading to about $\$$1400/year in electricity costs (<a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3">src</a>).</p>
<p>If we assume we want at least a 2.5KW solar panel array and storage for 30kWh, that's $\$$2000 to $\$$6500, which is 2-5 years before the installation pays for itself.
In five years time that changes to about $\$$800 to $\$$2500, which is about 0.5 to 2 years before the installation pays for itself.</p>
<p>Solar and battery technology might have a lot of hidden costs and other factors that might prohibit them from falling in price so drastically over the coming years
but when an installation gets within the cost of a single months electricity payment, it's hard to see how this couldn't become widely adopted.</p>
<p>2040 is a conservative estimate and is made in consideration that I'm no doubt missing a large number of other factors that come into play from creating, deploying and installing energy stations,
on the consumer or business side.</p>
