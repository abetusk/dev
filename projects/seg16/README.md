###### 2020-10-25

I ordered a set of 10 boards for about $50 from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/),
or about $5 per assembled board, with shipping etc.
I used the Gerbers in `export/gerber` along with `BOM` and `CPL` files in the
`wd/jlcpcb` directory.

I haven't actually ordered 30 (which seems to be the max for JLCPCB?) but it comes
to about $112, or about $3.75 per assembled board, with shipping etc. ($86.28 + $25.41 shipping).
