### Gall's Law

> A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author))

### Hanlon's Razor

> Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor)

### Gervais Principle

> Sociopaths, in their own best interests, knowingly promote over-performing losers into middle-management, groom under-performing losers into sociopaths, and leave the average bare-minimum-effort losers to fend for themselves.

Note: "The Losers are not social losers (as in the opposite of “cool”), but people who have struck bad bargains economically – giving up capitalist striving for steady paychecks."

### Gilder's Law

> Bandwidth grows at least three times faster than computer power

### Metcalfe's Law

> The effect of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law)


### Moore's Law

> The number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law)

### Occam's Razor

> Simpler solutions are more likely to be correct than complex ones.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor)

### Pareto's Principle

> For many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)


### Peter Principle

>  People in a hierarchy tend to rise to their "level of incompetence".

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle)


### Spolsky's Observation

> Smart companies try to commoditize their products' complements.

Note: In this context, there are 'substitutes' and 'compliments', where
a substitute is a product you buy that replaces the core product and a compliment
is a product you buy with the core product.

#### Ucaetano's Addendum to Spolsky's Observation

> Create a desert of profitability around you.

### Swanson's Law

>  The price of solar photovoltaic modules tends to drop 20 percent for every doubling of cumulative shipped volume.

Note: at present, costs halve at every 10 years.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swanson's_law)

### Wagner's Law

> The advent of modern industrial society will result in increasing political pressure for social progress and increased allowance for social consideration by industry.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner%27s_law)

### Wright's Law

> Production doubling leads to a constant percent decrease in cost.

aka Experience curve effects.

The above is paraphrased.
Wright noticed that every time total aircraft production doubled, the required labor cost fell 20%.

For unit number $n$, cost $P_n$ is approximately:

$$
P_n = P_1 n^{ \lg(\beta) } = P_1 n^{-\alpha}
$$

Where $(1-\beta)$ is the reduction proportion and $\alpha$ is the "elasticity of cost" ($\alpha = -\lg(\beta)$).
Note that $ \frac{ P_{2n} }{P_n} = 2^{-\alpha} $

It appears that $(1-\beta)$ estimates can typically range from $0.1$ to $0.25$.

Also note that economies of scale might be intertwined with with the experience curve effects and that it might be hard to separate the two.
